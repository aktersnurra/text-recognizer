# Text Recognizer
Implementing the text recognizer project from the course ["Full Stack Deep Learning Course"](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/march2019) in PyTorch in order to learn best practices when building a deep learning project. I have expanded on this project by adding additional feature and ideas given by Claudio Jolowicz in ["Hypermodern Python"](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).
